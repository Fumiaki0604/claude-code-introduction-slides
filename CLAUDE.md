# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Claude Code introduction slides project - a static HTML presentation system for demonstrating Claude Code capabilities. The project appears to be a template or starter with empty files that need to be populated.

## Architecture

The project follows a standard static site structure:

- `src/` - Source files for the presentation
  - `slides/` - Individual HTML slide files (01-introduction.html through 07-next-steps.html)
  - `js/` - JavaScript modules for slide navigation, code highlighting, and main functionality
  - `css/` - Styling with main.css, responsive.css, and theme.css
  - `index.html` - Main entry point
- `assets/` - Static assets
  - `data/` - JSON data files for code examples and commands
  - `fonts/` - Web fonts (Inter and JetBrains Mono)
  - `images/` - Icons, screenshots, and diagrams
- `scripts/` - Build and development scripts
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `examples/` - Example content and tutorials
- `dist/` - Build output directory

## Current State

**Important**: All core files (package.json, README.md, HTML, JS, CSS files) are currently empty. This appears to be a template that needs to be populated with actual content.

## Development

Since package.json is empty, no npm scripts are currently defined. The project structure suggests it's designed to be a browser-based presentation system that can be served statically.

To work with this project:
1. First populate the empty files with appropriate content
2. Set up package.json with necessary dependencies and scripts
3. Implement the slide navigation and presentation logic
4. Add content to the individual slide files

## File Structure Notes

- Slides are numbered 01-07 covering: introduction, preparation, installation, basic usage, examples, troubleshooting, and next steps
- The project includes placeholder directories for build output and documentation
- Asset structure is prepared for a complete presentation system with fonts, icons, and example content
